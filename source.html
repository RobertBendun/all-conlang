			ALL (A Language Language) is a conlang inspired by APL (A Programming Language),
			created for second Cursed Conlang Circus.
			To learn more see: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2fhHUuMxcA">Who Can Make The Most CURSED Conlang? (AGAIN)</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			What is cursed about this one, besides definition in hand-written HTML document?
			We don't have usual linguistic features and instead we write using explicit almost complete binary tree inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language)">APL</a>.
			Additionally it was defined by a programmer who's only knowladge about conlangs is a side effect of intrest in programming languages.
		</p>
		<h2 class="skip-toc">Table of contents</h2>
		<div id="toc">
		</div>
		<h2>Name</h2>
		<p>
			In ALL the name of the language is <em>alle alle alli</em>, which directly translated means "the most language of languages").
			Over time name ALL become shorthand for phrase.
			In ALL every name or foreign term is written using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_caps">ALL CAPS</a>.
		</p>
		<h2>Basics</h2>
		<p>
			Each word have different meaning depending on <em>arity</em>.
			Arity is marked using suffix, as shown in table below.
		</p>
		<table>
			<tr><th>Name</th> <th>Suffix</th> <th>Description</th> </tr>
			<tr><td>Niladic</td><td>i</td><td>Words and sentances that are "finished" and doesn't require any more input.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Monadic</td><td>e</td><td>Words and sentances that modify others</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Dyadic</td><td>u</td><td>Words and sentances that join others</td></tr>
		</table>
		<p>
			For example
			niladic <em>alli</em> means language, speech, communication;
			monadic <em>alle</em> means α speeks (like they speak) or α language (like programming language);
			dyadic  <em>allu</em> means α talks to β (like she talks to him).

			Monadic or dyadic words can be sentances on their own and are considered questions - <em>alle.</em> spoke to another person means "are you talking?" and <em>allu.</em> "are you talking to each other?" or "are we going to talk?".
		</p>
		<p>
			ALL follow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject%E2%80%93verb%E2%80%93object_word_order">subject-verb-object</a> word order due to it's construction.
			Words are read from left to right taking each completed (niladic) part as it's argument.

		Monadic meaning of pronouns translates to possessive use (<em>me</em> means "mine"),
		dyadic meaning of pronouns translates to seeing something like (<em>mu</em> means _ sees me as _).
		</p>
		<p>
			Phrase "she speaks his language" can be translated as "ti allu te alli" or "ti allu alle ti".

		<h3>Combined words</h3>
		<p>
			Most words are a combination of others.
			Monadic combination can be applied several times to emphesasie or escalate its argument.
			Here is a list of some combinations:
		</p>
		<ul class="two-column">
			<li>fish - ole mali</li>
			<li>lake - he oli - lots of water</li>
			<li>sea - he he oli - more then lots of water</li>
			<li>ocean - he he he oli - more then more then lake</li>
			<li>bee - male hole ini - friendly flying insect</li>
			<li>bees wings - olde ini oldu hol</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Examples</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>I work on my language. - mi du me alli.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Grammar</h2>
		<p>As in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form">EBNF grammar</a> using notation from linked article.
		</p>
		<pre><code>statement = sentance, '.', { sentance, '.' };
sentance = niladic
         | (monadic, whitespace, sentance_or_blank)
         | (sentance_or_blank, whitespace, dyadic, whitespace, sentance_or_blank);

sentance_or_blank = [ sentance ];

niladic = letters, 'i';
monadic = letters, 'e';
dyadic  = letters, 'u';

letters = letter, { letter };
letter = 'a'|'o'|'i'|'d'|'n'|'h'|'m';</code></pre>
		<h2>The Challange - Bee Movie quote</h2>
		<p>
			As defined in video mentioned at the start, the challange is to translate this wonderful quote to your language.
		</p>
		<figure>
			<blockquote>
				<p>
				According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly.
				Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.
				The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.
				</p>

		<h3>How to use writing system</h3>
		<p>
			Romanization of ALL is ambigious - it has the same problem as <code>5 x 4 y 3</code> where we have two valid groupings: <code>(5 x 4) y 3</code> and <code>5 x (4 y 3)</code>.
			Thats why preffered use of ALL is with its writing system.
		</p>
		<p>
			Write sentance using binary tree.
			Dyadic node is two times bigger then monadic or niladic node and has it's children writen below it in columns.
			Monadic node has niladic node beneath it.
			Niladic node has no nodes below.
